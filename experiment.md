[Go to index.html here!](shishir03.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/index.html) It is an amazing site, and you should click the link **right now**.

> This is the best site ever created.

This is due to the following reasons:
 - I made it
 - Did I mention that I made it?

So, all you have to do is the following:
 1. Click the link
 2. Be amazed

Anyway I think using `print` statements is the best way to debug

Like so:

```
try {
    return checkSimilarity(0x020514, img.getRGB(x, y)) < threshold;
} catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    System.out.println(img.getWidth() + " " + img.getHeight());
    System.out.println(x + " " + y);
    throw e;
}
```
